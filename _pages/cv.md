Projects & Activities
======
* Dec 2022 - May 2023: 3D Asset Texture Generation
  * Industrial AI software group project: Imperial College London & Loci
  * Project Goal: To simplify the 3D asset creation process by using AI to generate textures, given a mesh of an arbitrary object. The desired output format is a Python package and potentially API endpoints, which wrap your python functions.
  * Responsible for text-to-image task for texture generation and output post-processing.
